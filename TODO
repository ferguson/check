livereload has a issue with reloading the current build, it lags one behind
  - probably related to the extra coffescript & jsx compile cycles
  - the 'watch' mechanism is a bit crude (it's part of the web server, it
    should know which file changes are important for reloading and which to ignore)
  - this is probably fixable with more exacting livereload watch configuration
sourcemaps breaking jsx pipeline. break into more steps with more intermediate files?
are sourcemaps working? check this
and check sourcemaps through all the stages (coffeescript, jsx, browserfy, minify)
sourcemaps for sass
better error capturing in gulpfile so gulp watch doesn't exit
add 'watch' back as a dep for 'webserver' (or at least 'default'?)
watchify keeps bundlejs from completing (maybe this is expected)
make sure dependant gulpfile actions report back compleation correctly
not using bundle.min.js yet
missing favicon, icon, and iphone splash screen images
i think the bundle gulp tasks might be missing some dependencies
sourcemaps for css bundle and css minify?
ouroboros.css is not ready to be linted (gulpfile.js configured to skip it specifically)
css file bundling has no control over ordering
i wonder if the bad habit of using // to comment out things in css files breaks things when minifying (see ouroboros.css)
2d version layout is lame
note: react-three seems to require react 0.12.2 and not react 0.13
emacs .#* tmp files confuse stupid 'watch'
